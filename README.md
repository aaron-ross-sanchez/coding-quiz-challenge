# coding-quiz-challenge

## Description
In this repository, there are a total of 4 files that make up this coding quiz challenge(2 html, 1 css, and 1 javascript). Starting completely from scratch, this project was built first with a wireframe and high fidelity model of the pages to be created. Knowing that JavaScript will be involved with the quiz itself, I only created two HTML files, planning on using JavaScript to activate the quiz. The wireframe and high fidelity pages can be found below. Once the site was designed, the HTML was created, followed by generic CSS. With this CSS, I put a border around nearly every element so I could see what the box model looked like. Then, I started the JavaScript code by creating variables of every existing HTML element. I commented in the code my thought process with the JS code. The color pallete, wireframes, and high fidelity models can be found in the repo as well.
